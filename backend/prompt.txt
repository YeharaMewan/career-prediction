# Hierarchical Multi-Agent Career Guidance System

## System Overview
Create a hierarchical multi-agent system for career guidance with the following architecture:

```
Student Request → Main Supervisor → Final Career Plan

Main Supervisor orchestrates:
├── User Profiler Agent (Individual)
├── Career Planning Supervisor (Team Lead)
│   ├── Academic Pathway Agent
│   └── Skill Development Agent
└── Future Trends Analyst (Individual)
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Input Processing**: Main Supervisor receives student career guidance request

3. **Career Planning Delegation**: Main Supervisor sends profile to Career Planning Supervisor
4. **Career Identification**: Career Planning Supervisor identifies 3 suitable careers
5. **Detailed Planning**: For each career (can be parallel):
   - Career Planning Supervisor → Academic Pathway Agent → Education plan
   - Career Planning Supervisor → Skill Development Agent → Skill plan
   - Combine into complete career blueprint
6. **Future Analysis**: Main Supervisor → Future Trends Analyst → Market analysis
7. **Final Integration**: Main Supervisor combines all data into comprehensive report
8. **Delivery**: Present organized, readable final report to student

## Technical Requirements

- Implement hierarchical communication (agents report to their supervisors, not directly to Main Supervisor)
- Support parallel processing where possible (Academic and Skill agents can work simultaneously)
- Ensure modular design for easy expansion
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Include error handling and validation at each level

## Architecture Benefits
